**Columns (The Three Pain Points):**
1.  **The Data Silo:** You're manually juggling three screens—live stats, social feeds, and the broadcast. **The fragmentation is over.**
2.  **The Latency Trap:** The "vibe" is lost by the time the data is compiled. **Speed is currency, and you're losing relevance.**
3.  **The Signal-to-Noise Ratio:** Overwhelmed by bots and irrelevant chatter, you can't find the genuine fan voice. **You're missing the real story.**
**Stats:** "Content creators lose an estimated **40% of viral potential** by being 24 hours late to the conversation." (A strong, agitated statistic.)
